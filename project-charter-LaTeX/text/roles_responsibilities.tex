% 8 ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
Raytheon's stakeholders include the following two members:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gretchen Mock (RIS Senior Leadership) - Raytheon Mentor \& Point of Contact
    \item Jesse Lee (Competition Council) - UT Student Mentor
\end{itemize}
For this project, the CSE team consists of the following five students:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Javier - Student Team Lead \& Point of Contact
    \item Jaedyn Brown - Student Team Member \& SCRUM Master
    \item Robert Carr - Student Team Member \& FAA Certified UAV Pilot
    \item Ja'Lun Morris - Student Team Member
    \item Pearl Iyayi - Student Team Member
\end{itemize}
Currently, it is unclear what specific roles each member will be assigned, such as computer vision or autonomous flight. The current team lead and point of contact is Javier Lopez, who manages the student team and represents the team to McMurrough, the Raytheon mentors, and the student leader of the entire project. As well as being a student team member, Robert Carr will get his FAA UAV pilot certification. Prior to demonstrations, Robert will need to pass the relevant examinations and ensure that the drone is safe to fly within regulations. Jaedyn Brown holds the position of SCRUM master and is therefore primarily in charge of laying out the sprint backlog for each sprint, and giving time estimates for how long each of those tasks should take. The position of SCRUM master will be maintained throughout the duration of the project as Jaedyn's role.
