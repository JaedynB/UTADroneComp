The single board computer communicates information to the external components such as the motors and electronic speed controllers through our dedicated flight controller. The single-board computer will also connect to the camera and the required ACE Combat System. The dedicated flight controller will be linked to GPS and RTK systems. Drone motors will be connected to electronic speed controllers that are connected to the dedicated flight controller. In order to provide power to the entire system, a battery will be attached to the power distribution board.
