% 1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project is being undertaken in response to the growing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). With drone technology, there is increasing flexibility in the tasks that can be accomplished. A recent example of drones being used in places such as Ukraine has demonstrated their effectiveness on battlefields in dispatching enemies while protecting friendly troops. In the near future, global militaries will prefer to have autonomous machines fight for them over putting their troops at risk. This student team aims to conduct research in the area of autonomous drones that can destroy enemy targets on the ground in order to meet this growing demand for UAS. Student team members will gain a wide variety of drone technology knowledge along the way. Other areas outside of war zones can benefit from these aspects, such as disaster relief, land surveying, and police work.
