% 1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project is being undertaken in response to the growing demand for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). With drone technology, there is an increasing flexibility in the tasks that can be accomplished. The scenario that is presented is to be able to identify friendly ground vehicles and disarm hostile vehicles. In this use case, having a UAS that can fly autonomously and identify enemy vehicles could be used in various ways.
