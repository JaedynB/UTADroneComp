By researching and developing software that allows for the full autonomy of airborne drones, the student CSE team will address the rapidly growing demand for autonomous aircraft systems. Under the mentorship of Raytheon, the team will develop an autonomous ground vehicle and drone through coordination with undergraduate students studying Electrical Engineering (EE) and Mechanical Engineering (MAE). Through the use of a mounted camera, the team will implement computer vision that allows the drone to identify ground targets along with distinguishing between friends and foes while in flight. Upon detecting hostile ground vehicles within a 50-yard-by-50-yard area, the drone will fire a laser at the moving ground vehicle to indicate if the drone has successfully engaged and hit the target.
