% 2 METHODOLOGY
By researching and developing software that allows for the full autonomy of airborne drones, the student CSE team will address the rapidly growing demand for autonomous aircraft systems. Under the mentorship of Raytheon, the team will develop an autonomous ground vehicle and drone through coordination with undergraduate students studying Electrical Engineering (EE) and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE). By utilizing ArUco markers, the drone's camera will enable it to identify ground targets during flight to distinguish friends from enemies. Upon detecting hostile ground vehicles within a 50-yard-by-50-yard area, the drone will fire a laser at the moving ground vehicle to indicate if the drone has successfully engaged and hit the target.
