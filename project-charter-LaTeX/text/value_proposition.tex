% 3 VALUE PROPOSITION
The project is sponsored by Raytheon Technologies, an American multinational aerospace and defense company. In its role as a world leader in aerospace and defense, Raytheon understands the importance of investigating and developing unmanned systems. Raytheon will get to work with and monitor student teams and guide them as they develop unmanned air and ground vehicles through a two-semester-long project. Raytheon can use this mechanism to identify top graduates, promote corporate recruitment, and explore the latest technology trends. In addition to providing students with hands-on experience in unmanned systems, this project will also benefit the University of Texas at Arlington. Additionally, the university gains valuable experience in constructing unmanned systems through the involvement of professors in the student teams. It is critical to the university's success and distinction to involve students in research and industry standards like this.
