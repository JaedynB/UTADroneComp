The project is sponsored by Raytheon Technologies, an American multinational aerospace and defense company.  In its role as a world leader in aerospace and defense, Raytheon understands the importance of investigating and developing unmanned systems. Raytheon will get to work with and monitor student teams and guide them as they develop unmanned air and ground vehicles through a two-semester-long project. Using this mechanism, Raytheon can identify top graduates, promote corporate recruitment, and explore the latest technology trends.
