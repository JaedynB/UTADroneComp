% 10 FACILITIES & EQUIPMENT
In order to complete this project, the following facilities and equipment will be required:
\begin{itemize}
  \item UTA Maverick Stadium
  \item Senior Design Lab located in ERB 335
  \item 3D printer
  \item Makerspace
  \item Campus grounds
\end{itemize}
University of Texas at Arlington's Makerspace can be used if team members need to print any 3D parts. The Makerspace provides a 3D printer for parts printing. The Makerspace offers soldering stations that will be required for the drone build. These machines are already present in the lab and will not need to leave the room. Located in room 335 of the Engineering Research Building, the senior design lab will be accessible 24/7. Obtaining access to the lab requires a student ID and a pin number. UTA Maverick Stadium will host the showcase demonstrations when the competition is held. Flight testing may be conducted within the designated lab, or performed elsewhere on campus grounds where permitted.
